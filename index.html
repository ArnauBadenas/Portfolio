            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Arnau, a web developer with a lot of passion for bringing projects to live.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a developer, I'm proficient in a variety of programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                and Python. I'm also skilled in using popular frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular, and I have
                experience working with databases like MySQL and MongoDB.
            </p>
            <p>
                When it comes to web development, my approach is focused on creating clean, user-friendly designs that
                are optimized for performance and scalability. I'm passionate about finding creative solutions to
                complex problems and take pride in delivering projects that exceed my clients' expectations.

            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy playing volleyball, exploring the latest video games, and playing guitar. These
                hobbies help me stay creative and energized, and I often find that they inspire me in my work as a
                developer by showing me how to work as a team, and have a lot of dedication in what i do.

            </p>
            <p>
                If you're interested in learning more about my skills and experience, or if you have a project you'd
                like to discuss, feel free to <a href="#contact">reach out to me!</a>. I'd love to hear from you!
